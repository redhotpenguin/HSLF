Push Composer to-do list:  (/client/afscme/pushComposer/index)

On push submission (PushComposerController/actionConfirmation), server should talk to Urban Airship to deliver push messages.
If requests take too long, a worker can be used (see MobileUserController/actionExport for an example).

Tagging gotcha:
The phone uses the tag named 'default' to retrieve broadcast push messages from the back-end. However, that tag shouldn't be communicated to UA.
(/api/1/PushMessages/?tags=default,tag1,tag2,...). See https://github.com/OverlappingElvis/Oregon-AFSCME/blob/master/app/controllers/alertList.js#L39-L52


Transaction/Rollback should be used to save the message and payload
